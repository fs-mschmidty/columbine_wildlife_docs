Generally, canopy coverage is highly variable at the nest site. It looks like Goshawks prefer more dense stands than both Cooper’s and sharp-shinned hawks. Reynolds et al. (1992) recommends 50 to 70% for goshawks, but I think that these data show that goshawks will tolerate lower canopy cover percentages (U. S. Geological Survey 2024).</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>Around the nest, there is more difference between the species. Goshawk needs the most dense stands. Coopers and sharp-shinned need less stand density. Goshawk numbers generally match Reynolds et al. (1992), but here as well it appears that Goshawks will tolerate lower canopy cover areas at their nest sites.</p><p>I’ve struggled a bit at what window size nest stand should be evaluated at. The bigger the window the greater the likelihood that you will average non-nest stand areas into the equation. The smaller the window the less likely you are to characterize what a nest stand is. In this case I used a window of 5 pixels, or two pixels on any side of the nest pixel or about 75m from the nest. I think in the future I should increase this because Goshawk nest stands are roughly 30 acres. Thirty acre stands have a radius of approximately 200m (U. S. Geological Survey 2024).</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>Looking at the proportion of nests in each age class, we again see that Goshawks are the great generalists. While they prefer later successional classes, there are quite a few earlier successional classes (about 25%). This is counter to Reynolds et al. (1992) who says that nest stands are in late successional vegetation structural stages. Also interesting is that both Cooper’s and sharp-shinned almost exclusively occur in late successional stands (LANDFIRE 2023b).</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>What type of forest stands does each species occur in? Here it is predominantly Ponderosa pine for both Cooper’s Hawk and sharp-shinned hawk, while goshawk occurs in warm-dry mixed conifer forests and is also, again much more of a generalist (LANDFIRE 2023a).</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Fink, D, T Auer, A Johnston, M Strimas-Mackey, S Ligocki, O Robinson, W Hochachka, et al. 2023. “eBird Status and Trends.” <a href="https://doi.org/10.2173/ebirdst.2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://doi.org/10.2173/ebirdst.2022</a>.</p><p>Lambert, Mark B. 2021. “Final San Juan National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.”</p><p>LANDFIRE. 2023a. “LANDFIRE: Existing Vegetation Type.”</p><p>———. 2023b. “LANDFIRE: SClass.”</p><p>Reynolds, Richard T, Russell T Graham, M Hildegard Reiser, Richard L Bassett, Patricia L Kennedy, Douglas A Boyce, Greg Goodwin, Randall Smith, and E Leon Fisher. 1992. “Management Recommendations for the Northern Goshawk in the Southwestern United States.” U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest; Range Experiment Station.</p><p>Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center 2.0. 2024. “RMADC 2.0: A Portal for Avian Information from the IMBCR Program [Web Application].”</p><p>Romin, Prepared Laura A, and James A Muck.
