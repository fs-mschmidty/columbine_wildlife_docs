# Raptor DB - Data Dictionary and Description
Purpose, use, and fields for the ArcGIS Raptor Monitoring Database.
## Introduction

The purpose of this database is to record new and historic raptor nests on the SJNF and to collect reoccurring monitoring data at individual nest sites. Raptors are protected in the SJNF Forest Plan due to the sensitivity of these birds to disturbance during the nesting season and the decline in population numbers. Most raptor species have specific nest habitat requirements and high site fidelity shared making them highly impacted by changes in forest structure. Nests tend to occur in dense stands making nesting habitat vulnerable to management activities such as timber sales and prescribed burns.

Nest occurrence and monitoring data will be used to help minimize disruption from forest projects and ensure species protection. This database will be used to collect both opportunistic nest observations (nests found coincidentally) and nests located through formal raptor surveys of project areas. In addition to nest coordinates, observers should attempt to record species, nest condition, and nest activity. 

Establishing nest locations allows for seasonal buffer zones to be put in place to improve chances of reproductive success in areas with high disturbance. Knowing the species of raptor present in a territory or nest area is important for determining the protections needed and the condition of the nest may also be indicative of whether it is an active nest. Furthermore, the activity of raptors in and around the nest site is important for establishing whether the nest is occupied and active. 

New nests should be added as a point feature along with associated information about species, habitat and nest details. Point should be placed as close to the actual nest location as possible and manually adjusted if nest is inaccessible. A photo of the nest area with the nest location circled should be added to the nest point. Nests should be named based on location and species followed by a number (ex: Fosset Gulch Coopers 02). On ***both*** the initial visit and each subsequent visit to a nest, data will be recorded by selecting the nest point, and adding a data form under related data.
