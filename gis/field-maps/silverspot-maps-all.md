# Silverspot Butterfly Data Collection 

## Species Ecology 

*Speyeria nokomis nokomis* is a large species of fritillary butterfly native to Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Though their range spans across three states, they are restricted small, isolated patches of habitat which are steadily decreasing.

Preferred habitat for *S. n. nokomis* includes meadows, seeps, and marshes that are damp year-round. Northern bog violet (*Viola nephrophylla*) is the only known larval host plant for the species but is one of multiple common violets in the region, so it is important to be able to accurately identify it for the purpose of completing the following surveys.

Adult *S. n. nokomis* feed on a variety of nectar sources including thistles, horsemint, milkweed, and other flowering forbs.

Silverspot butterflies are one of the larger fritillary species, with a wingspan of up to 3.1 inches. Males have a bright orange topside with a brown-toned orange underside. Adult females are dark brown on top, with cream patches on the outer rim of their wings. The underside of their wings is more variable, with an orange topwing and cream to brown hindwing. Other sexually dimorphic fritillaries on our district can resemble the coloration of silverspot. The female great spangled fritillary has a topside which appears very similar to female silverspot, but the undersides differ significantly. It is valuable, for this reason, to obtain images (or video) of a butterfly's topside and underside during surveys.

# Silverspot Habitat Inventory Map
#### Data Dictionary and Description


## Introduction

We use this survey to document suitable silverspot butterfly habitat. The purpose of this collection effort is to document areas surveyed for bog violet on the SJNF. Bog violet is the only known larval host plant for the silverspot butterfly (*Speyeria nokomis nokomis*). Areas to survey are areas that are wet year-round and are under 9,300 feet in elevation (silverspot are currently only known to occur up to 8,300 feet, but an individual was detected at 9,300 feet). Negative detections are as important as positive ones, though we don't expect you to document literally everything you do, only areas that look like they could be habitat or are mapped as wetlands in the base map. We are particularly interested in areas that could be impacted by projects you are conducting. 

Please record and submit a line feature along suitable habitat and include images of wetland and bog violet. Be sure to include an image of the spur of the plant (if flowers present) so ID can be verified. 

## Details 
**Name of Map**: Silverspot Habitat Inventory - SJNF

**Fields:**
1. Name of Surveyor
2. Date/Time Survey Conducted 
    * Description: This field will generate automatically. If recording information for a previously conducted survey, please manually fill in date. 
3. Reason for Survey 
    
    * Description: Please look at the base map, if there is a polygon representing a wetland or other modeled habitat, please select "Modeled", if this is for a project or project planning, please select "Project", and if you just happened upon a wetland please select "Opportunistic".

    * Options: 
        
        * Opportunistic - Happened upon the habitat and decided to record an inventory.
        * Modeled - Habitat was identified in wetland, spring, or silverspot modeled GIS layers.
        * Project - Survey is associated with potential (not modeled) habitat for a project. If the habitat is modeled but within a project, please select "Modeled". 

4. Type of Habitat
    * Description: 
    * Options: 
        
        *  Spring or Seep - Water source originated from a spring
        * Lotic - Associated with the edge of a river or stream.
        * Lentic - Associated with the edge of a pond or lake. 
        * Fen - Associated with a fen.

# USFS_R2_SanJuan_Silverspot_Survey_v2
#### Data Dictionary and Description
 ## Introduction 

 We use this survey to record northern bog violet presence and patch boundaries on the Columbine RD. The primary purpose of this database is to identify suitable silverspot habitat and to determine whether an official silverspot butterfly survey is necessary. When you come across potential habitat, please first record a line survey in the Silverspot Habitat Inventory database. Then, if you have time, trace polygons in this survey or return to the site at a later date to do so.

 Please record and submit polygons illustrating the boundaries of bog violet patches. Attach images of bog violet for ID confirmation, when possible. Please include the spur of the plant in attached images if the plant is blooming. If not flowering, please be sure to include images of the stem shoowing whether the plant is acaulescent or caulescent.

 # Silverspot Butterfly Surveys
 #### Data Dictionary and Description

 ## Introduction 
 This database is used to collect official silverspot surveys on the SJNF. Three surveys are completed in each series, typically before a project is completed on habitat that has been deemed suitable for silverspot based on the Silverspot Habitat Inventory and USFS R2 SanJuan Silverspot Survey v2. This survey can only be completed from August to the second week of September, when *S. nokomis* is in its adult stage, so it is important to time the three surveys accordingly. 

 Please attach images of wetland and butterflies observed. If fritillary butterflies (especially silverspot) are present, please take multiple images for identification purposes.
