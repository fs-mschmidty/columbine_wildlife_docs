# Black Swift Historic Colonies and Monitoring Report

## Report Purpose 
In reviewing internal information on sensitive species in the San Juan National Forest, the wildlife shop came across a mess of files from 1998-2004 detailing Black Swift monitoring efforts across Colorado. These files ranged from technical conservation assessments, to species monitoring data.

Information from these files included:
* Species profiles and conservation assessments 
* Monitoring protocols and survey forms
* Monitoring site locations and descriptions 
* Site photos including nestling photos
* Data on habitat and swift occupation 

This report aims to briefly summarize the species assessment and monitoring effort, so that historic sites could be revisited and compared to existing data with minimal duplicated effort.

## Colorado Black Swift Background

### Identification 
Black Swifts larger than most other swifts, with a totally black underside are the only swift in Colorado that forages high above timberline and far from cliffs in single species flocks. 

### Phenology
Adult black swifts typically arrive in Colorado in early-mid June and begin nesting within three weeks of arrival. Chicks **fledge in mid-late September** and sometimes even into early October.

### Nesting

Black Swifts nest and travel in small colonies of usually 3-4 breeding pairs in the San Juans, but colonies can be as large as 18 pairs. Nesting pairs will lay 1 egg, with parents both contributing to nonstop incubation for 4 weeks. After hatching, the pair will brood continuously for an additional 2 weeks until chicks can thermoregulate independently. As chicks grow, adults leave during the day to hunt for food which they regurgitate to young in the evenings. Young fledge around day 45, however if a nest fails, breeding females may lay another egg, causing delayed hatching and fledging. Nest failure are fairly common with the most common reports being unexplained disappearances of eggs, young or even nests. This may be due to predation or startled adult causing sudden disturbances (potential concern in high traffic rec areas).

Black Swifts have very high site fidelity and are often observed to reuse the same nest for over 20 years, adding new material annually. Colonies have been observed in the same rock face within a site for over 60 years, perhaps due to an unusually long lifespan of 10+ years.

Several habitat characteristics have been identified as crucial to Black Swift Colonies, which are known throughout Colorado up to 11,000ft. Good nesting habitat is almost always near a waterfall with ***moderate-high water flow*** and significant spray in late summer, and a higher percent occupancy has been observed at mid elevation falls. Additionally a ***commanding view*** of surrounding terrain (also called relief) through a relatively straight path ***clear of obstructions*** such as branches is important for fledging. Other important characteristics include ***inaccessibility*** of rock faces to ground predators, ***shadiness*** of rock faces, and ***availability of moss*** in surrounding area. Finally the ***availability of niches***, pockets, ledges, shelves, and other recesses for nest building is a determining factor in weather colonies can successfully nest. 

### Feeding
Black swifts feed on a variety of flying insects, flying for most of the day gathering food. Flying ants particularly in the order Hymenoptera are a large part of Black Swift's diets, and they commonly target flying ant swarms. The nesting period of Black Swift colonies also coincides with seasonal hymenoptera swarms.


### Population and Conservation Status 
Population estimates from the early 2000's suggest around 100-125 colonies in CO, with total number of individuals in the state totalling around 650. Even considering the inaccessible and cryptic nature of these species reducing number of observations their total population in Colorado is almost certainly less than 1000 individuals. The small total population and small clutch size has let to Black Swifts being considered a sensitive species, despite having no formal statewide protections. 

Recent Breeding Bird Surveys suggest as much as a 94% population decline range wide, causing the Black Swift to be listed as endangered in Canada in 2019. Colorado hosts more known occupied Black Swift nesting sites than the entire remaining breeding range, and is listed as  a tier 2 species of greatest Conservation Need by Colorado Parks and Wildlife (Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, 2021).

## Monitoring History

### Early Site Discovery
The first intensive effort to locate Black Swift nesting sites in Colorado was led by Owen Knorr in the 1950's, and resulted in discovery of 27 active nest sites around the San Juan Mountains. All but two of these colonies were revisited in the late 90s and found to still have actively nesting Black Swift populations.

### Nest Site Inventory
Later monitoring efforts by both the Forest Service and the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory between 1996 and 2004 significantly expanded the number of known black swift colonies. By 2004 around 369 of 426 potential nest sites in Colorado were evaluated for nest habitat suitability, and 102 active colonies were located. Over 60% of these sites were located on Forest Service Land. Early survey work focus on inventorying potential habitat and cataloging active nest sites, therefore the data is not useful in inferring population trends.

### Current Monitoring
Although the Forest Service seemingly has not conducted Black Swift surveys since 2004, several individuals and organizations appear to have active monitoring projects. Sue Hirshman has continuously monitored the Box Canyon colony in Ouray for over 20 years, providing unique insight into nesting behavior and success. Additionally, the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies appears an active monitoring program in collaboration with Colorado Parks and Wildlife, although data is not publicly available.

## Future Monitoring Recommendations  

### Colony Locations on the San Juan

There are several sites in the Columbine Ranger District with potentially good nesting habitat, and even some sites with swift colonies recorded in the early 2000's, but none have been thoroughly surveyed. 

The focus for Summer 25 was to gather monitoring information from historic surveys, and collect site information to enable follow up surveys in future breeding seasons. Additionally, two high priority historically active sites (Cataract Canyon and South Mineral Creek Falls) were re-surveyed for habitat suitability, but follow up surveys are needed to assess Black Swift presence. Observers did note the presence of several Swifts near South Mineral Creek Falls but were unable to positively identify them as Black Swifts.

Black Swift information from several data sources, including known waterfalls, GBIF observations, and historic monitoring site data was cleaned and mapped (Figure 1)

### Locating Nests

Due to the cryptic nature of Black Swift nests, it is important to utilize existing information on site location and habitat suitability to maximize detection. Follow up surveys should prioritize locations with historic nests, followed by habitat suitability score (accounts for waterfall flow, relief above surrounding habitat, ariel predator access, rock face shading, and available suitable niches).

Historic surveys of sites with positive Swift detections are often accompanied by either written descriptions of nest locations or occasionally photographs of nest sites which can be used to relocate colonies with greater success. Information such as which side of of a canyon historic nests were located or distance up a fall can be critical in narrowing search areas particularly as many falls have multiple segments spanning hundreds of feet.

| Site Name | Access | Nest Location |
|---------|------|------|
Cataract Canyon | From Silverton follow S. Mineral Creek Rd to 1 mile below campground, cross the river and hike up canyon | Historic nests located on the east canyon wall 30ft and 50ft above base of lowest fall. Hike up on west side social trails.|
Porcupine Cascades | Drive 1.1 mile on Forest Rd 585 beyond clear creek crossing. Falls on left.| Nest at the top of the cascades on the south wall.|

### Data Sources and Paths

There are several important data sources that either detail previously surveyed sites, contain monitoring information for known sites, map species occurrence observations, or show possible unsurveyed sites.

GIS Data
* ***FS Black Swift Monitoring Colorado 96-04*** - Possible Swift sites visited between 1999-2004 based on dbf files cleaned and merged with R. Includes waterfall features (such as type, height and access), Swift signs observed (such as nests, adults, and young), date surveyed, etc.*
* ***Columbine Black Swift Monitoring 25*** - Present day surveys of possible or known Swift sites. Associated field maps surveys should be used when revisiting historic sites. **needs to be adjusted to work with current data*. 
* ***GBIF Black Swift Observations CO*** - All citizen science observations of Black Swifts (from eBird, iNat, etc) up to September 2025.
* ***CPW Black Swift Breeding Range*** - Known Colorado breeding range of Black Swifts. Does not include South Mineral or Telluride despite many historically active nest sites.
* ***Waterfalls Possible Black Swift Sites*** - Combination of surveyed and unsurveyed waterfalls that may have swift habitat. Some overlap with *FS Black Swift Monitoring Colorado 96-04* with newly added unsurveyed falls largely focused on South Mineral.

*note: coordinates for historic data were handwritten and contain errors. Several points should be excluded, but will remain in dataset until manually corrected.

R Script 
* ***black_swift_survey_data_merge*** - cleaning and combining several csv's from old dbf's, adjusting formatting, structure and coordinates to be consistent across different years.

### Recommended Monitoring Protocol
There are several potential survey methods to confirm colony presence and monitor populations. The *evening adult count* method is ideal for establishing colony presence at sites with good swift habitat. Once adult presence is confirmed, more intensive *nest searches and chick counts* can be conducted.

Evening adult counts aim to detect Black Swifts as they return to the nest to feed. During early incubation and hatch periods one parent sits on the nest while the other travels long distances to gather flying insects, returning periodically to the nest to deliver food. Approximately two weeks after the young hatch, both parents leave the nest and begin traveling further to feed returning infrequently and often in the last two hours of daylight. In order to get an accurate adult count surveys should after the two week post hatch period. It is recommended that surveys be conducted at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post hatch, with hatch date estimates by state, latitude, and elevation shown in table 2. If only one survey can be should ideally fall around 6 weeks post hatch.

| Location | Latitude | Incubation | Hatch | Fledge|
|-----------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
California (sea level)|	37° N	|23 May	|19 June	|2 August
Montana (4,700')|	47° N	|15 June|	12 July|	25 August
Mexico (9,100')| 20° N|	17 June	|14 July|	27 August
California (4,900')	|34° N|	22 June	|19 July	|1 September
Colorado (7,800')	|38° N	|3 July|	30 July	|14 September
Colorado (10,100')|	37° N	|8 July|	4 August	|17 September   

*table 2: Nestling phenology at various locations*

Locating nests is important in assessing the reproductive capacity of a colony and, in some cases, ensuring that colonies are minimally impacted by recreation. The best time to conduct nest searches is early in the nesting season near the hatch date when adults are frequently visiting the nest. Nest search visits early in the season are best conducted at midday when there is maximum light to survey dark niches.

### Partner Organization Monitoring Efforts

Although the Forest Service only has data recorded up to 2004, the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory seems to have continued some form of Black Swift Monitoring to the present day. Coordinating monitoring protocols and updating data and sites based on recent efforts could significantly aid in our understanding and management of Black Swifts on the San Juan National Forest. Rob Sparks (rob.sparks@birdconservancy.org) and may have insight into how we can best monitor and manage this sensitive species.
